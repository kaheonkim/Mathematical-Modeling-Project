Relationship between Nation’s trading community and its Economic growth


# 1. Theme

: Nation’s trading community and its Economic growth**

# 2. Goal

- Verify the relation between nation’s trading community and its
Economic growth by using correlation measure.
- Extract mathematical datas by network measure and analyze
it by using statistical measures.

# 3. Data & Network Construction

Data1 : Trading datas
link : http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/presentation.asp?id=37

Data2: GDP Growth

Constructing dictionary of growth rate for
each country and for each year.

Network Construction
For Trading datas
Undirected Network
Node : Country
Edge: Trades (integrated)
Weight: Volume of the trade 

# 4. Measure

: How can we verify the relation and predict the future?

# 5. Procedure

- Correlation: Correlation between ‘Clustering Coefficient growth’ and ‘GDP growth’
- Year by Year approach
- Country by Country approach

# 6. Result

- Year by Year approach
    
    Correlation: Correlation between ‘Clustering Coefficient growth’ and ‘GDP growth’
    
- Country by Country approach
    
    Correlation: Correlation between ‘Clustering Coefficient growth’ and ‘GDP growth’
   
   
# 7. Conclusion

Clustering Coefficient: Community Joining Measure

Clustering Coefficient Growth: Community expansion

- For each year, country whose trading community becomes larger tends to show high GDP growth, but it is ambiguous.
- Most economically grown countries show positive relation between expansion of community and GDP growth.
